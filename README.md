## Project Overview

Organizations store thousands of documents including SOPs, HR Policies, IT Guidelines, Security Manuals, Maintenance Documents, and Technical Knowledge.

Finding the correct document takes time, and employees often receive outdated or incorrect information.

**OnlyTech** solves this problem using an AI-powered Knowledge Repository where:

- Employees upload documents
- AI learns from approved documents
- Employees ask questions in natural language
- Administrators verify every uploaded document
- Incident reporting and tracking are integrated into one platform

---

## Problem Statement

Traditional document management systems suffer from:

- Difficult document search
- Duplicate files
- No AI assistance
- Manual knowledge sharing
- Unauthorized document access
- Lack of approval workflow
- No centralized incident management

---

## Proposed Solution

OnlyTech provides a centralized AI-powered platform where:

- Employees securely upload documents
- Admin reviews and approves submissions
- AI indexes approved knowledge
- Employees ask questions in plain English
- Incidents are tracked centrally
- Complete organization knowledge remains up-to-date

---

## User Roles

There are two separate portals.

### Employee

Responsible for:

- Uploading documents
- Updating existing documents
- Using PlantMind AI
- Reporting incidents
- Viewing personal dashboard

### Administrator

Responsible for:

- Managing repository
- Reviewing uploaded documents
- Approving or rejecting documents
- Managing incidents
- Monitoring AI usage
- Managing system settings

### Step 5 — Admin Notification

Admin immediately receives **1 Pending Approval**.

### Step 6 — Update Existing Documents

Employee selects an already uploaded document. Can:

- Replace document
- Update content
- Modify description

The updated version goes into **Pending Review**.

### Step 7 — PlantMind AI

Employee opens **PlantMind AI**.

Example questions:

- How do I configure VPN?
- Explain leave policy.
- What is the onboarding process?
- Where is the network security SOP?

AI searches only the **approved repository**.

Response includes:

- Relevant answer
- Source document

### Step 8 — Incident Reporting

Employee opens **Maintenance** and creates an incident.

Example:

- Printer not working
- VPN issue
- Server downtime
- Network failure

Incident contains:

- Title
- Description
- Priority
- Timestamp

Status becomes **Open**.

### Step 9 — Recent Activity

Employee dashboard stores:

Everything appears inside **Recent Activity**.

---

## Admin Portal Workflow

Administrator has complete control over the system.

### Dashboard Overview

### Step 2 — Admin Decision

Admin can **Approve** or **Reject**.

**If Rejected** — Employee receives notification:
> Rejected — Reason: Incorrect Version

**If Approved** — Document moves into the **Knowledge Repository**. PlantMind AI automatically gains access.

### Step 3 — Knowledge Repository

Repository becomes the organization's official knowledge base.

### Step 4 — Incident Management

Admin opens **Active Incidents**. Can:
